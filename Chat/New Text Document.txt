here are the datasets I	 have suggested and here are the smart questions from the motor vehicle collision dataset 


a)What is the distribution of accidents by borough?
b) Are there any specific locations (streets, intersections) that have a higher frequency of accidents?
c) Which contributing factors are most commonly associated with accidents?
